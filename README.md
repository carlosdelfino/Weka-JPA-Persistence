### Welcome to Project page from WEKA JPA Persistence Framewor.


***

Version 0.0.2 Released: 
Finishing the first version that generates data, with this release we can already generate the header and simple data JPA entities with at least one interface type ManyToOne being the daughter entity treated as a string.

Removed unnecessary dependencies


***


What makes me want to develop this project:
* Not having to worry about parameters of access to the database, since having my integrated application to JPA
* Use Entities (POJO) JPA and its metadata to generate the ARFF when you need to outsource information for use by third parties.
* Generate new Entity (POJO) JPA based on information obtained in the ARFF
